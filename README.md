# Project Motivation

In this project, I practiced skills of Data Engineering model to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.

Firstly, we targeted the ETL pipeline.Then store the data into the database. Then secondly, we cleaned data from random anomalies to build a model, so that we can classify the messages, that includes in Machine Learning pipeline.

Our objective was to deploy model at the web application. So we can classify the messages that were basically asked from the website or internet.
